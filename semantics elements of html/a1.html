            and night vision are much better than that of humans. Cats are supposed to have 18 toes (five toes on each front paw;
            four toes on each back paw). Cats can jump up to six times their length.Cats conserve energy by sleeping for an average of 13 to14 hours a day. Cats have flexible bodies and teeth adapted for
